## GETTING STARTED

In order to tailor this code to your needs please read here. All the names of the images are self explanatory however you may find yourself stuck on the mechanocs of the game so heres a guide. Character refers to the actual chicken jumping so any functions or declarations with the begining name character refers to any and all changes to said character. Now while i dont recommend changing the jumping function if you do theres a couple things you must know changing th number added towards floorHieght on either function will drastically change the jump/fall speed so do be careful. As for the obstacles the time  have on default will allow you to play the game as intended however if you wish you can change the speed on obstacle interval. happy coding :)

## PREREQUISITES
there are no dependencies required for thi game so no init is required if youd like to revise the code and add dependencies i am more than welcome of any contribution.

## INSTALLATION
In order to properly install the game you can use the published version however i do recommend first forking the code and running LIVE SERVER on VSCODE this will allow you to see real time changes when you change any code.
theres not much else to install i kept it very simple so that anybody would be able tochange this code to there liking.
